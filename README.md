ðŸ“Š Tableau Projects Portfolio
Welcome to my Tableau Projects Portfolio!
This repository contains interactive dashboards and data visualizations Iâ€™ve created using Tableau. The projects here demonstrate my skills in data analysis, data storytelling, and visualization design.

I will continue to update this repository with new Tableau projects as I complete them.

ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
Each project is organized in its own folder and may contain:

Project Report / Notes â€“ Brief description of the project goals, data source, and insights found.

Tableau Workbook (.twb or .twbx) â€“ The source file for the dashboard.

Exported Images / PDFs â€“ Screenshots or static exports of dashboards.

Link to Tableau Public â€“ View the live, interactive dashboard online.
